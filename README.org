* My .dotfiles
- emacs
  + sorted into three sections: ~global settings~, ~major mode hooks~,
    and ~appearance~
  + themes are loaded lastly to make it very clear when something has
    gone wrong (since it's obvious when the theme hasn't loaded) 
- bashrc
  + mostly preconfigured by xfce
  + modifications to environment variables for running emacs in
    client/server
